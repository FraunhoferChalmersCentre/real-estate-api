  Specification of a local controller supplying heat by means of a Temperature Curve. Formatted as a list of breakpoints,
  where each breakpoint indicates the supplied feedTemperature for a given outdoorTemperature.
required:
  - breakpoints

      description: >
        feedTemperature, outdoorTemperature pair. Provided in the same unitOfMeasure as the corresponding sensors.
      required:
        - feedTemperature
        - outdoorTemperature
      properties:
        outdoorTemperature:
          type: number
        feedTemperature:
          type: number
    example:
      - outdoorTemperature: -10.0
        feedTemperature: 75.0
      - outdoorTemperature: 0.0
        feedTemperature: 57.0
  minFeedTemperature:
    type: number
    description: The minimum temperature that the Temperature Curve controller is configured to output. Null can be used to signal that the breakpoint values can be extrapolated.
    example: 20.0
  maxFeedTemperature:
    type: number
    description: The maximum temperature that the Temperature Curve controller is configured to output. Null can be used to signal that the breakpoint values can be extrapolated.
    example: 80.0
  lastModifiedAt:
    type: string
    description: >
      The date-time of the last configuration change to this controller.
